# Note on data files

Original data files were provided by Robert Nosofsky and retrieved from the [The Ohio state university cognitive modeling repository](http://cmr.osu.edu/browse/models?pid=64&sid=80:attention-similarity-and-the-identification-categorization-relationship).

I created the .csv-files to reproduce the model-based analyses reported in Nosofsky, R. M. (1989). Further tests of an exemplar-similarity approach to relating identification and categorization. *Perception & Psychophysics*, 45(4), 279â€“290. doi: [10.3758/BF03204942](http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/BF03204942).
