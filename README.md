# Collection of cognitive models

This is a little collection of my implementations of computational models of cognition in R.

## Cognitive model repositories
If you are looking for more computational models of cognition, take a look at the following repositories:

- [The Ohio state university cognitive modeling repository](http://www.cmr.osu.edu/): Contains datasets that can be modeled and the cognitive models themselves
- [Repository of Neural and Cognitive Models](http://models.nengo.ca/): The goal is to provide enough information here that a researcher can run the models detailed in a particular publication or project, as well as gather and analyze the resulting data. The models here typically use Nengo, but other models are welcome.

If you know of any other repositories that provide code and/or data for cognitive modeling, let me know so I can add them to the list.
